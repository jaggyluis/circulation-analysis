- freezes when agent does not have a node type that it is on
- all entities should have an environment variable
X components need an internalized "name"
X barriers should be recogized with resolution too small
- agents need a floor property
X fix bound on density maps for output
- nodes need wait times
X bidirectional template
- what happens if a path is not possible?
- implement time remainder on agents
