X fix points not on mesh
- finish recursive search for points not on mesh

- freezes when agent does not have a node type that it is on
- what happens if a path is not possible?

- all entities should have an environment variable
X components need an internalized "name"
X barriers should be recogized with resolution too small
- agents need a floor property
X fix bound on density maps for output
- nodes need wait times
X bidirectional template
X lost agents in void
X do not default to original choice when capacity is met

- implement time remainder on agents
