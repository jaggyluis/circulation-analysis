 
X all entities should have an environment variable
X components need an internalized "name"
X barriers should be recogized with resolution too small
X agents need a floor property
X fix bound on density maps for output
X nodes need wait times
X bidirectional template
X lost agents in void
X do not default to original choice when capacity is met

------------------------------------------- c# versioning changes

X fix all constructors

Agent
X what happens if a path is not possible?
X add queuing time propensity

Agent Settings:
X make sure it outputs non null even with just count input
X Count should be called AgentCount
X All profile / settings objects should have toString methods
- add node visit counts

Environment
X getter and setter methods should be generalized to entity rather than type
X write all warning messages
- implement simulation distribution - environment settings?
X Environment Resolution should not be below 1
- create an environment primitive type so that environments can be internalized
- add a better mechanism for building agents that does not use the environment, so that multiple types can be tested

Node
X points not on mesh
X node zones

Analysis
X zone density per generation / total
X maybe remove zones from search similar to barriers?
X Node map is produceing invalid meshes

Optimization:
X can shortest path be precalculated?

General:
- handle curves
