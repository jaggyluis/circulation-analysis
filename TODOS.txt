 
X all entities should have an environment variable
X components need an internalized "name"
X barriers should be recogized with resolution too small
X agents need a floor property
X fix bound on density maps for output
X nodes need wait times
X bidirectional template
X lost agents in void
X do not default to original choice when capacity is met

------------------------------------------- c# versioning changes

X fix all constructors

Agent
- freezes when agent does not have a node type that it is on
- what happens if a path is not possible?
- add queuing time propensity

Environment
- getter and setter methods should be generalized to entity rather than type
- write all warning messages
- implement simulation distribution - environment settings?

Node
- finish recursive search for points not on mesh
X node zones

Analysis
X zone density per generation / total
X maybe remove zones from search similar to barriers?

Optimization:
- can shortest path be precalculated?
